# OSC - ASU : A Journey Through History

_Open source is not just about code; it's about the power of individuals coming together to create something meaningful and impactful._

Welcome to the chronicles of the **Open Source Community at Ain Shams University**. This documentation unveils the journey of a passionate group of students who, fueled by the spirit of collaboration and knowledge sharing. We started with the goal of spreading open-source culture in our community. We never imagined that we would be able to achieve what we have today. We are proud of what we have accomplished and are excited for what the future holds. 

The history is the most important thing in any community, it's the thing that makes the community alive and makes it grow through the years. This is why we decided to document our history. We want to preserve the history of the community and make it available for everyone to read and learn from. We hope that this documentation will inspire others to start their own open-source communities and help them grow.
